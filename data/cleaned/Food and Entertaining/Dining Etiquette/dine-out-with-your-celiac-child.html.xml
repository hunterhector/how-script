    <tips>
      <tip>
        <ul>
          <li>Call a restaurant twice before you visit with your gluten sensitive child. Make the first call several days ahead to see if the restaurant is a viable choice for your family, and call once again on the day you will be dining at the restaurant.</li>
          <li>Notify the restaurant in advance about which day you will be eating out so that the management can be sure that gluten-free menu ingredients are available.</li>
        </ul>
      </tip>

    <warnings>
      <warning>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not let your child share food off of your plate as some of your food may be contaminated with gluten-containing food items.</li>
          <li>Avoid cream sauces, cheese sauces, gravy, and all fried foods as these often contain flour which is used as a thickening agent or a crisp outer coating.</li>
        </ul>
