      <tip>
        <text>Call a restaurant twice before you visit with your gluten sensitive child. Make the first call several days ahead to see if the restaurant is a viable choice for your family, and call once again on the day you will be dining at the restaurant.</text>
      </tip>
      <tip>
        <text>Notify the restaurant in advance about which day you will be eating out so that the management can be sure that gluten-free menu ingredients are available.</text>
