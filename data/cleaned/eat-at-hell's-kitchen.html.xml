        <em>Know somebody.</em>
        <details>
          <d> Tickets to view and eat on the set of </d>
          <d>Hell's Kitchen</d>
          <d> are in high demand. Most people who have had luck getting into the show's studio audience simply knew “the right person.” As such, if you know someone connected to the show or connected to Fox Broadcasting, make use of that acquaintanceship.
</d>
          <d>
            <l>Make your request directly to the person you know rather than going through official channels.</l>
            <l>The more influence your contact has within the company or with the show, the more likely you are to succeed in your appeal.</l>

          <d> While the official </d>
          <d>Hell's Kitchen</d>
          <d> e-mail address is provided online for casting inquiries, you can also use it to inquire about ticket reservations.
</d>
          <d>
            <l>Send an e-mail to: hellskitchen@theconlincompany.com[1]</l>
            <l>Within the body of the message, express your interest in reserving tickets. Provide your full name, the number of tickets you would like to request, your phone number, and your mailing address.</l>
            <l>Also ask for additional information regarding ticket requests. You might be instructed to pass your request onto another source.</l>

        <em>Request tickets by mail.</em>
        <details>
          <d> Write a quick letter expressing your interest in tickets to </d>
          <d>Hell's Kitchen.</d>
          <d> State how many tickets you would like to request, along with your name and address. You should also include a stamped, self-addressed envelop that the show's directors can use to send you your tickets.
</d>
          <d>
            <l>When applying postage to the self-addressed return envelop, use "Forever" stamps instead of relying on other stamps or postage paid without the "Forever" seal. Postage rates could go up by the time an opening appears on the show.</l>
            <l>You may also want to include your phone number. If a last minute opening arises, you may receive a phone number asking about your availability.</l>
            <l>The address to use when writing your ticket request is:[2]

        <em>Beware of scams.</em>
        <details>
          <d> Tickets can only be obtained through Fox Broadcasting or by a direct invitation from someone connected to the show. Many second party websites claim that they can obtain tickets to </d>
          <d>Hell's Kitchen</d>
          <d> and other reality TV shows, but more often than not, these websites are scams.
</d>
          <d>
            <l>As hard as it might be to believe, real tickets to the show should cost you nothing. If a second party website wants your credit card information or other financial data, that website should not be trusted.</l>
          </d>
          <d>
</d>
        </details>
        <em>Check the website for updates.</em>
        <details>
          <d> The show's official website once had a "Reservations" section on its front page, located near the bottom of the screen. As the show rose in popularity, a backlog of reservation requests developed, and producers removed that section from the website. Nonetheless, you should continue to check the webpage for updates on whether or not reservations are actively being requested.
</d>
          <d>
            <l>You can always send in a request through one of the other methods described here, even if reservations are not being accepted on the website.</l>
            <l>The website can be found at: http://www.fox.com/hells-kitchen/</l>
          </d>
          <d>

        </details>
        <em>Wait.</em>
        <details>
          <d> Chances are, reservations for the next season or two of </d>
          <d>Hell's Kitchen</d>
          <d> are already booked up. If you are patient enough to wait several seasons, though, you might be lucky enough to get a spot sometime in the future.
</d>
          <d>
            <l>Additionally, there is some chance that a guest will cancel, creating an unexpected opening as a result. When this happens, producers turn to their back-up list of reservation requests. Your name could be selected as a last minute fill-in, especially if you live in the Los Angeles area, around the location of the show's filming.</l>

        <em>Know what to expect.</em>
        <details>
          <d> Hell's Kitchen is not an actual restaurant. The kitchen and dining room are on a soundstage, so your dining experience will not be anything like what you might expect at a real eating establishment.</d>
          <d>[3]</d>
          <d>
</d>
          <d>
            <l>Even after you obtain tickets, there is no guarantee that you will actually be able to eat anything there, and you will be asked to sign a form signifying your understanding of that.</l>
            <l>Service will be slow, even if you do eat. Expect the visit to take at least three hours. As you wait, however, you will be given free alcohol and bread.</l>
            <l>Most people who have visited the set of the show report that the food is decent, but not fantastic. If you still want to go, do so for the entertainment experience and not for the sake of a great meal.</l>
